Outside of what is criminal or wrong from a personal perspective, most behavior just \"is\".  Don't try to explain people's behavior to themselves.  We all have trouble looking in the mirror, but women especially have trouble.  They see themselves and their behavior with a completely rationalized viewpoint and that is completely instinctual and mostly a result of their brains being completely devoted to selective reproduction and leveraging other people to survive.  Men are different in that their brains are less robust when it comes to rationalization because their drive is to acquire skills, resources and people to allow them to procreate with every possible female.
